# URL-Shortener-App

- A URL shortener app is a tool or service that allows users to create shorter, more manageable versions of long URLs .
- In this, the user is able to shorten the URL and can copy the shortened URL.
- The different pages present in the project are as follows:-
  - Home Page
  - About Page
  - Login Page
  - SignUp Page
  - Forgot Password Page
  - User Profile Page
- I have used the firebase for storing the data of the users.
- I have used the styled components, formik and yup.
- I have configured the eslint and prettier file.

## :sparkles: Functionalities:
1. The user can login and signup in the form and the form has all the validations that are required.
2. The user details are stored in the firebase in the collection.
3. The forgot password functionality is implemented where the user gets the reset password link in their email.
4. I have used the react-loader-spinner and react-social-icons as well.
5. The user can view its profile and update.
6. The user can paste the link to shorten and it will give the shortened link and provided the copy-to-clipboard functionality.
7. The logout functionality is also present.
